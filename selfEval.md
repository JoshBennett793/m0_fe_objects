# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

	It felt good to flex some of the muscles we've been developing the last few days. While this is review, it's good to see how far I've come since I first started learning some of these concepts. Admittedly, I still had to look up various syntax to make sure I was using certain methods the right way.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

	Today was a pretty good day in regards to focus. I took longer than expected with the documentation portion of the functions assignment, making it obvious that there should be some wiggle room on the calendar for things that take longer than expected. I felt in the zone for a good portion of my time working on the assignments so I didn't feel breaks were too necessary but I took some natural breaks like letting the dog out and getting snack and that felt sufficient.

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?

	I learned that I can always keep improving the reusability of my functions, especially as we start using functions in more complex ways. I can also remember to keep functionality in mind when naming my functions, to provide as much clarity as I can to the developers who read or use my code.
